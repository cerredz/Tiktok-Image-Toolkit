A highly detailed 5K, cinematic photograph of a dramatic 3D illustration, set against a vast, starry space background, depicting a massive, swirling black hole with vibrant, electric blue and purple hues, its event horizon warping and twisting the fabric of space-time. In the foreground, a lone astronaut, clad in a sleek, white spacesuit with a reflective, gold-tinted visor, is plummeting headfirst towards the black hole's void, their body stretched out in a desperate, futile attempt to escape the gravitational pull. The astronaut's facial features are obscured by the visor, but their skin tone is a warm, golden brown. The image is rendered in a gritty, realistic science fiction style, with subtle, filmic grain and textures that evoke a sense of unease and cosmic horror.
