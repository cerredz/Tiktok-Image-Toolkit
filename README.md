# Tiktok-Image-Toolkit

## Overview
**Tiktok-Image-Toolkit** is a tool designed to streamline the process of creating TikTok slideshow videos by automating image generation. The script reads sentences from the `sentences.txt` file and generates corresponding images using the Flux Dev model. Additionally, it offers the option to email the generated images to the user. The tool can also be used to generate images for general purposes beyond TikTok video creation.
