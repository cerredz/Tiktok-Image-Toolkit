**Config.json:**
- This file contains the configuration / customizable options for the application. It starts off containing default values that we think are best suited for TikTok videos.
- The options are as follows: 
    - "Image": dictionary containing the following keys:
        - "width": 
            - the width of the image in pixels.
            - must be between 256 and 2048.

    - "output_directory": the directory where the images will be saved.
        - must be a valid directory path and can include spaces. Ex: "images" or "images/mountains" or "images/planets in space"

    - "model": the name of the hugging face model to use for image generation.
        - "FLUX.1-dev" is the default model, private / custom models must be duplicated from the Hugging Face website and used here.
        - other recommended model is "Flux.1-Schnell"


    - "hf_token": your hugging face token, 
        - before running the main.py file, you must generate a token here: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens and then put it in the config.json file under the "hf_token" key.

    - "num_inference_steps": the number of inference steps to use for the image generation.
        - range depends on the model, but for "FLUX.1-dev" it must be between 1 and 28.
        - this is the quality / detail of the image. 1 will be the lowest quality / detail, 28 will be the highest quality / detail.
